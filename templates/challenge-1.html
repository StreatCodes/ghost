        <h2>1. The Adaptive Firewall Crisis</h2>
        <p>The neon glow of your cyberdeck's display casts harsh shadows across your face as you crouch in the abandoned
            maintenance tunnel beneath Nexus Tower. Static crackling through your neural dampener, you jack into the
            building's network through a forgotten ethernet port—a relic from the old days that ZENITH's scanners
            somehow missed. Your fingers dance across the haptic interface as you probe the first layer of security, and
            a smile creeps across your face. This access point is running legacy protocols from before Nexus fully
            integrated their systems with ZENITH. The authentication gateway displays crude ASCII art and text-based
            prompts—ancient by current standards, but also refreshingly straightforward.</p>
        <p>"Ghost, what's your status?" crackles through your encrypted comm from Cipher, the resistance's mission
            coordinator. "I'm in luck," you whisper back, studying the vintage security system. "This old maintenance
            access still uses pre-AI authentication. It's basic cryptographic challenges and logic puzzles—the kind of
            thing they used to test junior programmers with." You recognize some of the patterns from your early days at
            Nexus, back when human ingenuity still mattered more than algorithmic brute force.</p>
        <p>The system presents its challenge: a series of encoded messages and logical sequences that need to be decoded
            to gain access to the building's internal network. It's almost nostalgic, like solving puzzles from the old
            days when hacking was about wit and creativity rather than AI-assisted warfare. But there's no time for
            nostalgia—once you're past this gateway, you'll have access to the lower-security internal systems that
            could provide a pathway to Sector 7. The resistance is counting on you, and this vintage puzzle is your
            first step toward uncovering Nexus's dark experiments.</p>

        <hr />

        <p>As you interface with the ancient terminal, lines of seemingly random ASCII characters scroll across the
            screen. Your old Nexus training kicks in—you recognize this as a legacy authentication cipher that the early
            programmers used to secure maintenance access points. The system waits patiently for you to decode the
            character sequences and provide the correct numerical key.</p>

        <p>You recall the rules of the cipher system as followed:</p>

        <li>Letters (A-Z, a-z) = their alphabet position (1-26), case insensitive</li>
        <li>Digits (0-9) = their numeric value</li>
        <li>Any other characters = 0</li>

        <p>Here are some examples:</p>

        <code class="block">123
            a@c6d
            m9(02)gc2
        </code>

        <li>The first line would equal <code>6</code> - <code>1 + 2 + 3 = 6</code></li>
        <li>The second line <code>14</code> - <code>1 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 14</code></li>
        <li>And the third <code>36</code> - <code>13 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 36</code></li>


        <h4>Task:</h4>
        <p>Calculate each line's total and add all the totals together. In the example above the final total would be
            <code>56</code>
        </p>

        <p>When you enter the correct authentication code, the ancient terminal responds with a satisfied beep and
            displays "ACCESS GRANTED - MAINTENANCE LEVEL." The forgotten ethernet port comes alive with data flow,
            granting you backdoor access to Nexus Tower's internal maintenance network - a low-security system that
            handles building operations like elevators, ventilation, and most importantly, the service tunnels that lead
            directly to Sector 7.</p>
