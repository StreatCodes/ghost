        <h2>Ghost Protocol</h2>
        <p>The year is 2087. The mega-corporation Nexus Dynamics has effectively become the shadow government of
            Neo-Tokyo, controlling everything from data flows to genetic modifications. Their AI overlord system,
            ZENITH, monitors every citizen through neural implants, social credit scores, and omnipresent surveillance
            drones. Privacy is a relic of the past, and dissent is algorithmically predicted and suppressed before it
            can manifest.</p>
        <p>You are "Ghost" - a legendary hacker working with the underground resistance cell known as The Disconnected.
            Your specialty is infiltrating Nexus systems while leaving no digital footprints. The resistance operates
            from abandoned subway tunnels beneath the city, using pre-digital technology and hardened systems to avoid
            ZENITH's detection.</p>
